## Natural Language Processing Projects

### Overview
This is where I play with NLP, aka Natural Language Processing, the art of teaching machine to understand and mimic human's natural language (semantically and/or syntactically).

Projects in this repository are still in progress and gradually updated. README's content will be updated accordingly. Maybe I'll write some blog posts if necessary.

### Content
At present, this repository contains the projects below.

1/ [Embeddings](https://github.com/ChunML/NLP/tree/master/embeddings)

DONE:
- CBOW
- skip-gram

TODO:
- Rewrite in Tensorflow 2.0
