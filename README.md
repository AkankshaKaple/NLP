## Natural Language Processing Projects

### Overview
This is where I play with NLP, aka Natural Language Processing, the art of teaching machine to understand and mimic human's natural language (semantically and/or syntactically).

Projects in this repository are still in progress and gradually updated. README's content will be updated accordingly. Maybe I'll write some blog posts if necessary.

### Content
At present, this repository contains the projects below.
